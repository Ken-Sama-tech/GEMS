# violation-logger

If you open this README file and see this... thats great it means you have eyes and can see, more than that you can also read.

if you're just here to read this, then you better not theres nothing to read here.

Anyway, if you want to update this and you find it hard to understand, due to the my intricate coding style,
then you'll gain nothing here. I didn't write any documentation for this project, since this was the first project I made after I learned every languange that is used in here. Anyway just try to contact me. Who knows maybe I might be able to help you, although I may have forgotten everything I did in this code.

It'd better if you create your own code from a scratch, than understanding this code that is INCOMPREHENSIBLE even for me, its creator.

I doubt anyone is crazy enough to even look at these codes. If you really want to study this code of mine, I left some nonesense comments on my code that might be able to help you.
